                            <p>I have 5+ years of experience as a developer of video games, specializing in roles requiring narrative design and game design. From school, employment, and personal interests, I have done <span class="c skill">story writing</span>, video editing, graphic design, <span class="t skill">programming</span>, and many things in between.</p>
                            <p>It is through the accumulation of these various skills that I excel in <span class="skill">collaborating with experts</span> in their respective disciplines, and am confident in my ability to coordinate the team and <span class="skill">lead projects to completion.</span></p>

                            <p>I consider myself a game designer not solely from an ability to think and understand <span class="skill">what makes games fun</span>, but also from my proven experiences breaking down and detailing game concepts. Thanks to my technical background, I excel in <span class="skill">clarifying all the features</span> needed to compose a properly structured game. Furthermore, due to my success-chasing personality, I enjoy <span class="skill">defining the milestones</span> of the production pipeline, setting goals and utilizing the talents of the whole team.</p>

                            <h5>Q: What kind of games do you like?</h5>
                            <p>I am most fascinated by narrative-driven game projects that have a storyworld and characters, especially when there is unity in gameplay, art, and all other elements in the game's overall purpose and impact on players.
                            </p>
                            <p>Games are capable of creating immersive, compelling, and meaningful stories experienced through play. In other words, game narrative design goes beyond merely written dialogue; it is about using the <span class="t skill">interactive features of a game</span> to <span class="c skill">closely involve players in the world it creates</span>.</p>

                            <p class="text-left">In 2020, I graduated Simon Fraser University with a Bachelor of Arts (with Distinction) in Interactive Arts and Technology, in which I learned a wide variety of technical skills applicable to many industries.</p>
                            <p class="text-left">I completed three co-op work terms where I worked for web and game-related companies, and also studied Storytelling Across Media in an international exchange in Sweden.</p>

                            <p class="text-left">Aside from video games, my hobbies include writing short stories, reading comics, watching anime, and sometimes remembering to practice kendo or the drums. During university, I also co-founded a manga club and helped manage its events and projects for 5 years.</p>

Tools used are Bootstrap and jQuery for front-end, Brackets as a coding platform, and GitHub for tracking and hosting. I found and edited royalty free images for the icons.</p>
